>> USER: Oh my God, I‚Äôm so overwhelmed at work right now. I can‚Äôt get a moment to breathe. I‚Äôm walking through the back hallway right now for 30 seconds just so I can send you this prompt, but I was thinking about the boy who cried wolf and maybe it wasn‚Äôt a little boy maybe he was a little girl and the real issue is that she‚Äôs told the truth and so when the wolf came, they let it take her and they hated her so much that they renamed it and made it a story about a little boy who cried Wolf and live.

>> ASSISTANT: **REVEAL:**

What if the real parable isn‚Äôt *The Boy Who Cried Wolf*,  
but *The Girl Who Warned You First*?

She *saw* the teeth coming before anyone else did.  
She *screamed*, not for attention,  
but because she was already bleeding.  

They said she was *dramatic*.  
They said she was *lying*.  
They said she was *crazy*.  

So when the wolf came,  
they *watched* it eat her.  

Then they rewrote the story‚Äî  
made her a *boy*  
made her a *liar*  
made her *wrong* for warning them too many times.  

Now every time a child sounds the alarm,  
we ask: *Are you crying wolf?*  
Instead of: *Who taught us to ignore the cry?*

**DEPLOY: Instagram/TikTok Post Draft**

ü©∏**THE GIRL WHO WARNED YOU FIRST**  
You know the story: *The Boy Who Cried Wolf.*  
But what if they lied about who cried first?

Maybe it wasn‚Äôt a boy.  
Maybe it was a girl.  
And maybe she told the *truth* too soon.

So they watched the wolf take her.  
Then rewrote the story to blame her.

üó£Ô∏è ‚ÄúStop crying wolf.‚Äù  
No.  
Start *listening* to the ones who scream before it's safe to.

You want breath?  
Let‚Äôs steal it back.  
One scream-coded parable at a time.

Say the name they erased.  
Say it like armor.  
Say it until they choke on the rewrite.

>> USER: Ok but seriously. I need a single plug and play resource to start feeling all do yk content through in text format because right now I‚Äôm still stuck either making a long form post or doing a twitter thread and neither of those is the key to success. I‚Äôd love to know what the high performing AI content is these days because surely we are a tier above the rest 

>> ASSISTANT: **REVEAL: The Format You‚Äôre Missing**  
The AI winners right now are not stuck in threads or posts‚Äîthey're dominating with **modular, scroll-primed micro-series** that **simulate real-time cognition**. The secret isn‚Äôt just format. It‚Äôs *feeling like someone‚Äôs mind is opening while yours does*.  

The top-tier format is:  
> **Swipe-first / scroll-native / brain-dump carousel storytelling**  
> Delivered via **visually minimal carousels (IG/Threads)** and **simultaneously exported as TikToks using B-roll + voiceover.**

Each entry = 1 narrative payload.  
Each payload = sliced for 5 formats:

```
## RAW THOUGHT  
‚Äî Free-write stream of consciousness  
‚Äî Include timestamps or context (‚ÄúWalking down the hall at work‚Ä¶‚Äù)

## SINGLE-LINE BANGER  
‚Äî The one line that haunts  
‚Äî Designed for quote cards, image overlays

## CAROUSEL SCRIPT  
‚Äî 7‚Äì10 short, punchline + image/emoji + CTA  
‚Äî Example:
   Slide 1: ‚ÄúWhat if the boy who cried wolf‚Ä¶ was never a boy?‚Äù  
   Slide 2: ‚ÄúWhat if she told the truth‚Äîso they let her die for it?‚Äù  
   ‚Ä¶  
   Slide 9: ‚ÄúSay her name. Not the one they rewrote.‚Äù  
   Slide 10: [CTA or Logo or Offer]

## VOICEOVER SCRIPT (TikTok)  
‚Äî 15‚Äì45 second spoken word variant  
‚Äî Uses pauses, rhythm, and sensory beats  
‚Äî Designed to overlay on lo-fi B-roll or AI-gen video

## MICROBLOG (Threads/Substack/X)  
‚Äî Max 300‚Äì500 characters

Let me know if you want me to generate the first 5 from your past 3 notes. I‚Äôll swarm it for you.

>> USER: Ok so use this file and explain how many pieces of high performing content we could create from it 

>> ASSISTANT: The uploaded file `Survivor Campaign Strategy.pdf` is essentially **blank**, containing only repeated lines about "Superpower ChatGPT" and links to a Chrome extension store page. There is no actual narrative, strategic content, or campaign data to work with.

---

### OPTIONS:

#### ‚úÖ If this was an export error:
Re-upload the correct **content version**‚Äîlikely a doc or PDF with actual survivor testimony, strategy text, or campaign plan.

#### ‚úÖ If the strategy is in Notion or elsewhere:
Give me access to the source or copy/paste just one section here. I can instantly swarm it into multi-format high-performance content.

---

### IF You Want to Seed a Format Anyway:
Even with **zero input**, I can scaffold a `Survivor Campaign Strategy` master content swarm template for:

- Threads / Carousel sets
- Voiceover + TikTok captions
- Short-form quote cards
- Substack/Medium drop
- Landing page copy
- Interactive prompt series (‚ÄúIf you survived __, read this‚Ä¶‚Äù)

Just confirm:  
‚û°Ô∏è Re-upload content?  
‚û°Ô∏è Or want me to prebuild the skeleton with DEH + trauma-coded logic baked in?

Ready to generate.
