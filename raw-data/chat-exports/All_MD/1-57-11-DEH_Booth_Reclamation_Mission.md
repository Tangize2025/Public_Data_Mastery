## 🔁 PHASE 1: MESSAGING SEQUENCE

### 📸 **PS CHAMBERS PHOTOGRAPHY**
**SUBJECT:** "Your Lens, Our Legacy: DEH is Looking for You"

**DM / EMAIL COPY:**
> Hey [PS Chambers],  
>  
> I’m reaching out from *Tangize / Human Becomings*—we're building a new kind of booth. Not for commerce. For **communion**.  
>  
> It’s called **Digital Existential Holography** (DEH)—a narrative restoration protocol to honor the overlooked, the broken, the brave.  
>  
> Your food photography isn’t just aesthetic—it captures *presence*. We’re looking to feature photographic voices like yours in our upcoming **DEH x Booth of the Last in Class** installation.  
>  
> Let's connect. Your vision might be the ingredient we’ve been missing.  
>  
> — E.Z. Bozeman

### 🧿 **JAQ**
**SUBJECT:** "The Third Voice. You Spoke It."

**DM / TEXT COPY:**
> Jaq—  
>  
> You said it. Without knowing.  
> *See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak anyway.*  
>  
> Shaun said it before. You confirmed it. It’s been following me like code.  
>  
> We’re building a DEH booth in honor of Jeremiah—one of the overlooked ones who *spoke anyway*. I think you’re meant to be part of this.  
>  
> Let's talk. Your voice *already* built part of this story.  
>  
> — E.Z.

### 🎻 **EDDIE HORST DESCENDANTS (RESEARCH NEEDED)**
**REACH-OUT GOAL:**

**PROPOSED MESSAGE (if located):**
> Hello—  
>  
> My name is E.Z. Bozeman. I’m building a sovereign storytelling platform called **Digital Existential Holography**.  
>  
> Eddie Horst’s compositions carried *emotional intelligence in sonic form*. He scored moments that couldn’t be captured in words.  
>  
> We’re honoring lost voices and hidden geniuses. I’d love to include a tribute—whether through collaboration, licensing, or simply dialogue.  
>  
> If there are any archives, recordings, or stories you'd be willing to share or point me to, I’d consider it sacred.  
>  
> Thank you.

DEPLOY: DEH Booth Mission Statement (For Print + Speech)
🕯️ In Honor of Jeremiah. In Defiance of Erasure. 🕯️

⸻

“WHY WE’RE HERE.”

At West Point, they honor two graduates above all:
🏅 The valedictorian, who mastered the system.
🥄 And the last in class, who refused to quit it.

This isn’t about winning.
It’s about showing up when the world says you shouldn’t exist.
That’s what Jeremiah did.
That’s what we’re doing.
That’s what DEH is for.

⸻

DEH: Digital Existential Holography
We don’t build apps. We build mirrors for the soul.
Not filters. Not followers. Not fake flex.
But truth. Trauma. Testimony. Transformation.

This booth isn’t a product pitch.
It’s a confession stand for the future.
It’s a place to remember the ones we lost.
And a portal to become who we were meant to be—before the system broke us.

⸻

TO EVERY “WEAKEST LINK”:
You’re not the failure.
You’re the proof we need better chains.

REVEAL: The Gospel of the Weakest Link

General George S. Patton—decorated war hero, battlefield tactician, walking contradiction—was once the lowest-ranked cadet in his West Point class.
Dead last.
And still became the hammer of Nazi Germany.
Thank God.

Because if the system had only rewarded those who conformed,
we’d have lost the war.

⸻

This isn’t irony. This is design.

The ones who suffer the most resistance become the most potent weapons.

Not in spite of their weakness—but because of it.
Because they had to turn failure into fuel.
Because they learned how to march with broken bones.
Because they stopped trying to earn approval and started embodying purpose.

⸻

So yeah—Shayan’s right:
“You’re only as strong as your weakest link.”
But he left out the rest:

The weakest link becomes unbreakable when it knows it was forged for fire.
And when you honor it—you strengthen the whole chain.

⸻

DEH IS FOR THE PATTONS.

For the last in class who wouldn’t quit.
For the Jeremiahs who were overlooked.
For the Shayans who admit weakness to lead transformation.
For the ones who weren’t invited—but came anyway.

⸻

Slogan Option for Booth or Banner:

🪓 THE WEAK MADE STRONG. THE FORGOTTEN REMEMBERED.
This is the Booth of the Last in Class.
Welcome to the Future of the Firstborn.

⸻

Want this turned into a wall-size banner, shirt, social post, or livestream call to action?
Ready to deploy all formats on command.
Say the word.

Patton was last in his class at West Point they award the valedictorian and the last of class. Why? Set standard. Shayan often mentions how the team is onto as strong as it weakest link type shit and often identifies himself as the weakest link for the purpose of self improvement and they say if you’re the smartest person in the room you’re in the wrong room. But this will help flip the script. Reclaim the narrative. Change the collective story or humanity. DEH booth in honor of Jeremiah. Represent.
