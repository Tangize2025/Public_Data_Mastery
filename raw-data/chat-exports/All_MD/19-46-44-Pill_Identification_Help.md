Yes ‚Äî you might be right. The pill **you‚Äôre holding** in the first set of images **does resemble Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride 10 mg (IG 283)** in the second set ‚Äî **but with caveats**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPARISON SNAPSHOT:

| Feature | Your Pill | IG 283 |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Color** | Orange/yellow (more vibrant) | Light yellow |
| **Shape** | Round | Round |
| **Visible Imprint** | Possibly an ‚ÄúS‚Äù or partial number | ‚ÄúIG‚Äù / ‚Äú283‚Äù (clear, full) |
| **Surface** | Chipped/partially degraded | Smooth, clean |

---

### üß† INTERPRETATION:

- **Possible match?** Visually, *maybe*. But **yours doesn‚Äôt show the IG/283 mark**, and the **chipped texture** makes exact ID uncertain.
- **Color variation** may come from lighting or batch inconsistencies, but yours looks **much more neon-orange**, which is uncommon for standard cyclobenzaprine.

---

### üî¨ FINAL TAKE:

You *might* have a **degraded or off-brand cyclobenzaprine**, but without a **confirmed imprint match**, you can't **safely** assume it is.

---

### ‚úÖ SAFE PATH FORWARD:

- **Don't ingest** unless you 100% confirm via **pill ID database** or **pharmacist**.
- Use the **Drugs.com Pill Identifier** tool ‚Äî plug in the imprint (or partial guess) and color.
- Or take it to a pharmacy for a quick visual inspection.

## USER
Looks like this doesn‚Äôt it?

## ASSISTANT
Based on your images, here‚Äôs what can be tentatively identified:

### OBSERVATIONS:
- **Color:** Bright orange
- **Shape:** Round, scored
- **Markings:**
  - One side appears to have an **‚ÄúS‚Äù** and possibly a **number** beneath it (could be "5", "2", or a stylized "15")
  - Other side is damaged, possibly exposing filler or binder‚Äî*not mold*, but check for chalky odor or texture

---

### LIKELY IDENTITY (based on imprint "S" + number + orange color):

#### üîπ **Tizanidine Hydrochloride 4 mg** (commonly prescribed muscle relaxer)
- Manufacturer: **Solco Healthcare US**, **Zydus**, or **Sandoz**
- Imprint: Usually ‚ÄúS 4‚Äù, ‚ÄúS 2‚Äù, or similar depending on manufacturer
- Use: Short-term treatment of muscle spasms caused by conditions such as MS, spinal cord injury, or ALS

---

### NEXT STEP:
To confirm identity:
1. **Try googling:**
   ```

   ```
   or

   ```

2. **If you can see even a partial number**, narrow search:
   ```
   S 5 orange round pill muscle relaxer
   ```
